# FirmAI
## Leading Research for AI in Business

### Becoming a Contributor

FirmAI seeks to get academic research and models into the mainstream. Two platforms targeted for this purpose are GitHub and Medium. FirmAI’s authors are selected based on the quality of their research they produce, their expertise in an area of interest, and their previous involvement in open source projects. The publication is add-free and entirely funded through GitHub and other grassroot sponsorships. Every year five authors would be awarded with an annual medium membership.

The FirmAI publication aims to produce high quality slow streaming content. Authors are individually approached based on their publication record and the interest factor of their work. The publication would be an original publication looking at practical and useful applications and theories from academia and industry. We are looking for the best researchers to propose up-to-date content, focused on the intersection of computer science, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence and ethics with business.

We make use of a rolling editor and reviewer model. Our editors all have advanced degrees and work in a range of professional and academic institutions. As it stands we have five propsective reviewers and editors who collectively have professionally reviewed articles for or have published in IEEE Computation Intelligence Magazine, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Journal of Financial Economics, Journal of Banking and Finance, Journal of Portfolio Management, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, and the European Journal of Operations Research.

Every article would go through a thorough review process before the article is scheduled for publication. After every submission the expectation is at most two rounds of reviews. Publishing in FirmAI will enable you to reach a broader audience and earn money through the Medium Partner Program if that so interests you. You also remain the only owner of your work, in accordance with the Medium Terms of Service, which you agree to when signing up for a Medium account. You will be able to edit or delete your article at any moment, even after we have published it. The feedback our editors and community provide to you will appear at the relevant place in your article. You will be able to dismiss or respond to them.

Every year five authors would be awarded with an annual medium membership. This award would go to the authors whose ratio of predicted level of views (by two reviewers at the start) to actual number of views is the highest. To us this is testament to a low click-bait article that has gone unnoticed. Earnings are also based on the amount of time member’s spend reading authors’ articles, this diminishes the incentive for clickbait articles.
